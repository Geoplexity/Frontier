# Cluster API

This package provides an interface for manipulating Clusters. Clusters are an annotation of a hypergraph/flow structure
that represents a solvable subsystem of the sketch.

Functionality is provided to generate a graph via "condensation" of a cluster: the component constraints and shapes of
the cluster are removed and replaced with a representative node.
