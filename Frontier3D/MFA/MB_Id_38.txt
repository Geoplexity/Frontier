   MSEL = 1            !(D=1) to select between full user control (0, then use MSUB) and some preprogrammed alternative: QCD hight pT processes (1, then ISUB = 11, 12, 13, 28, 53, 68), QCD low pT processes (2, then ISUB = 11, 12, 13, 28, 53, 68, 91, 92, 94, 95)   MSTJ 11 = 3            !Choice of the fragmentation function
   MSTJ 22 = 2            !Decay those unstable particles
   MSTP 2 = 1            !2nd order running alphaS
   MSTP 33 = 0            !(D=0) inclusion of K factors in hard cross sections for parton-parton interactions (=0: none, i.e. K=1), (=1: a common factor is used, as stored in PARP(31) ), (=2: separate factors are used for ordinary(PARP(31)) and colour annihilation graphs (PARP(32)) ), (=3: A K factor is introduced by a shift in the alphas QQ argument, alphas = alphas(PARP(33)QQ)
   MSTP 51 = 4            !structure function chosen
   MSTP 81 = 1            !multiple parton interactions 1 is Pythia default
