Purpose of this file
======================
Breakdown of the reorganization between the main branch and this branch

Breakdown
=============
mfa1 -> GDS/List.hpp
mfa2 -> GDS/Random, Vertex, Edge, Graph, Cluster
	only graph needs random?

mfa3 -> DRP/Cluster_Print.hpp

mfa4 -> UTU/Group.hpp

mfa5 -> DRP/Cluster_Get.hpp
mfa6 -> DRP/Dist_Flow_Edge_Method.hpp
mfa7 -> DRP/Dist_Methods.hpp
mfa8 -> DRP/Dense_Algo.cpp

mfa9 -> ESM/ESM.cpp
mfa10 -> ESM/ESM.hpp
mfaTree -> ESM/mfaTree.hpp
cData -> ESM/Cluster_Data.hpp



GDS = Graph Data Structures







ESM.cpp line 407,542,601,685,762 what to return?



Moving functions
=================
    Dist_Methods needs from ESM:
        getContainedChildList
            -> moved into GDS/Cluster.hpp (with inOriginalV and getChildNameWithVertex) now a method
        getEdgeCodeDRPlanner
            -> moved to DRP/Dist_Methods, now called getEdgeCodeDRP
        getOverlapList
            -> moved to GDS/Cluster.hpp (added include graph in there... wonder if there's a way to do it without giving clusters a knowledge of graphs?)

    Cluster_Get@copyG
        -> moved into GDS/Graph as method copyInto

    Graph@Graph@sketchInput
        -> moved into UTU/makeGraphFromInput.hpp, no longer a method
        Had to make dimension, numvert, vertices, numedge and edges public... would like to change that once I can test


ESM.cpp@getPartOverEquation uses mfaAlgo... this belongs in utu





Just make the code crash if it ever gets to the part where it needs DRP
