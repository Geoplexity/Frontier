Important Papers
================
- Andrew's PhD



Peters and ruijin root solver, to incorporate in ESM
	maybe release as own project





/CISE/research/constraints/public_html/GNU


Problems
========
- minimum dense subgraph (non-trivial) good approx algo for decomp/recomb
- Uniqueness of the decomposition (equivalence classes of decompositions)





Perhaps make ESM/ESM.cpp@getEdgeCode and DRP/Dist_Methods.cpp@getEdgeCodeDRP into a single method
