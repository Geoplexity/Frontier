Equation and Solutions Manager

Input:

The ESM takes as input one graph structure which specifies all of the vertices and constraints
in the original constraint system drawn in the sketcher, and a decomposition tree that was the
output of the DR-Planner.  At input, Deg_values fields in both the vertices contained in the
graph and the Deg_values field in the clusters are initialized but empty.

Output:

The ESM caluculates the position and orientation of each of the vertices and then clusters in
the system and stores these values in the degvalues fields of the clusters in the DR_Tree.
Directly before returning to the sketcher, the solver transfers all of these values into the
degvalues field in the vertices of the graph, eliminating the copies of the singleton vertices
in the DR-Tree, and placing all in the values in a list rather than a tree, making access to the
individual values more convenient.  In addition after the solver has completed, the solved field
in each of the clusters in the DR_Tree has been set to true to reflect the fact that each
cluster had been solved.
