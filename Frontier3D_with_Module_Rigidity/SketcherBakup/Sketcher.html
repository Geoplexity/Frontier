</FONT>
<UL>
<!-- Edit this section to keep track of your to do items -->
<LI>[B] Finish local clipboard functions
<LI>[BK] UTU (Universal Translation Unit -- for communication between Sketcher and CA & ES)
<LI>[K] Touch-up shape icons
<LI>[K] Make shape icons for display in ComboBox (will need to be diff dimension..see shapeicon.gif for size)
<LI>[B] Create a "Recent Files" class and implement it
<LI>[B] Finish SKMapleUTU
<LI>[B] Don't allow users to change a Line's PointType to Infinite if there are constraints on that point
<LI>[B] Don't allow an Infinite point to be chosen from the constraint property editor
<LI>[B] Add "solved" boolean to SKItemInterface (and all constraints and shapes), and have it effect the color used to draw
<LI>[B] Add methods to recursively set solved to false (true set by UTU) when a constraint changes, is removed, etc
<LI>[B] Allow deleting of constraints and shapes
<LI>[B] Add labels that are drawn with the constraint lines (option to turn off) with a contraint-specific icon and data (ie distance for distance constr, etc)

<LI>[BK] When adding shape and adding reference to cmbShapes, added shape's props change
<LI>[BK] Switching to Constraints tab messes with shapes
<LI>Resolution -- Setting panelShapeArea.Layout=null did the trick, it was apparently resizing the components automatically
<P>
<LI>Changed Vectors to ArrayList, ArrayList is faster, but not syncronized (not threadsafe..threads cannot modify it concurrently)
<LI>Changed ArrayList to type-specific arrays to eliminate almost all typecasting (which is time-intensive)
<P>
<LI>When multiplying/dividing by a power of 2, use >> and <<.  x/4 becomes (x >> 2) and x*8 becomes (x << 3)
